# 🎥 Watch List Project

## 📝 Description

The project allows a user to create lists in which they can save their favourite movies.

Based on a challenge from [Le Wagon bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time), it aims to build a 3-model app and the main key feature is a many-to-many relationship.

My goal is to make use of the simple guidelines to practice:
* building an app with Rails 7
* writing tests with RSpec, FactoryBot and Capybara
* using Stimulus
* styling with TailwindCSS

### 🧰 Built with

* [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/)
* Ruby on [Rails 7](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the default database
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)
* [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs), [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails), [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
